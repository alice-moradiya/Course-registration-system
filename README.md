# Course-registration-system

The project involved designing and implementing a course registration system that allowed students to register for 
courses of their choice while the system admin registered courses for the students. 
As part of the project, the system was designed to create a transcript for each student, which would include a report of all the courses taken, 
grades earned, and credits earned. Overall, the project is about software development, database management, and project management.
